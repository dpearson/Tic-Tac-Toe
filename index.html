        <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>

<p>This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game, written in Java. It was originally a programming assignment for an introductory Computer Science class.</p>

<h3>Playing the game</h3>

<p>At runtime, the game prompts for a difficulty level from 0 to 2, with the highest difficulty level being 2. Then, simply click on a square to play a piece there. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or when either the human player or the computer wins.</p>

<h3>AI</h3>

<p>The AI is hand coded, and should be unbeatable at the highest difficulty level. It is capable of looking ahead in order to detect potentially fatal situations, but does not learn (there is really no need). However, it does not play to win; it only plays to avoid losing. It is capable of winning, but only on such occasions where the human player essentially hands it the game.</p>

<h3>Contributing</h3>

<p>The codebase is messy, and it could use some cleanup. However, the biggest need is simply testing. If you manage to beat the AI on difficulty level 2, please <a href="https://github.com/dpearson/Tic-Tac-Toe/issues/new">file an issue</a> with the game you played.</p>
